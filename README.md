### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States which are Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
----------
The answered questions are:
What month occurs most often in the start time?
What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What is the earliest birth year?
When the oldest person was born?
Most recent birth year?
Most common birth year?
